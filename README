iTunnel
=======

iTunnel is probably the smallest useful RubyCocoa application ever. It also is my first one-hour
attempt to using RubyCocoa.

iTunnel puts itself in the menu bar and presents you configurable hosts to open and close SSH
tunnels. No more, no less.

Configuration
=============

Configuration is in YAML format. Create a file in your home directory called .itunnels with the
configuration in the following format for each host:

-
  name: My SSH Tunnel
  host: myhost.example.com
  login: username
  local_port: 1234
  remote_port: 5678
  url: /

The dash on its own line is important. The configuration parameters are the parts the SSH tunnel
command. The url parameter specifies the relative URL that is to be opened by the web browser as
soon as the tunnel is established (actually, iTunnel just waits 2 seconds and then opens the
browser, regardless if the tunnel is actually open yet).

Note that there is no password parameter. If you want to use iTunnel with your remote host, make
sure your specified user uses an SSH key.

Getting it
==========

git clone it, or look in the Downloads section on github.

Although I did not copy & paste code, the macistrano application (http://github.com/mattmatt/macistrano)
was of great help and inspiration for iTunnel, mainly because it is very similar in its minimalistic
user interface.
